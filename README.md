# ECS-Terraform
I will use containers based deployment with an autoscaling tool to scale the application based on CPU and Memory usage. To build this environment on AWS I used the services listed below:

* VPC and Networking (Subnets, Internet Groups...)
* Elastic Container Registry
* Elastic Container Service
* Application Load Balancer
* Auto Scaling
* Cloud Watch
